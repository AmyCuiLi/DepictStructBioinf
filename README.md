# DepictStructBioinf

This script aids in the visualization of aggregated structural bioinformatics information. Like a tape player, it's a general framework that can take project "casettes", containing relevant sequence alignments, 3D structures, and functional annotations. Its main purpose is to help compare functional annotations within families of proteins, thereby enabling researchers to operate with a high level of domain knowledge for a relatively small time investment.
